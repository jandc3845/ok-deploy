    OK Deploy – A continuous deployment pipeline implementation to
    transport applications to a runtime context using build-packs.

    “OK Deploy” helps you to deliver applications to their intended
    target runtime, and manage them during their life-cycle while
    remaining in the data center.

    It is designed to have similarities to ``git``'s interface. “OK”
    projects are normal ``git`` repositories, with some conventions
    on the file system structure and branch names applied.
